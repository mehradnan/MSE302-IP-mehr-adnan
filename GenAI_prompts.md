Here are 5 of the most widely used mental-health / CBT-related apps worldwide, with what they focus on, rough download scale, and the intervention type:

App	Primary focus areas	Approx. downloads*	Intervention type
Calm	Mindfulness, stress, anxiety, sleep (Sleep Stories, breathwork)	50M+ (Android) 
Google Play
	Self-guided mindfulness/relaxation content; evidence-informed skills practice (not pure CBT).
Headspace	Mindfulness, stress, sleep; plus therapy/coaching add-ons in some regions	10M+ (Android) 
Google Play
	Self-guided mindfulness courses and exercises; optional human coaching/therapy; CBT-informed tools.
Wysa	Anxiety/depression self-help, mood tracking, sleep	1M+ (Android) 
Google Play
	AI chatbot using CBT/DBT techniques with optional human coaching/therapy.
BetterHelp	Access to licensed therapists for a wide range of concerns	1M+ (Android) 
Google Play
	Teletherapy (live/video/chat) with licensed clinicians; modalities vary by therapist (CBT commonly available).
Talkspace	Online therapy & psychiatry, individual/couples/teen	500K+ (Android) 
Google Play
	Teletherapy and psychiatric care via licensed clinicians; CBT and other modalities depending on provider.

*Downloads shown are Google Play install bands as of October 10, 2025; iOS installs aren’t publicly listed and would increase overall totals.

If you’d like, I can tailor this to CBT-only self-help tools (e.g., replace therapy platforms with apps like Woebot or MindShift CBT) or narrow by a specific use case like insomnia, panic, or mood tracking.


##PROMPT
>> Find reviews and studies, summarize the most common gaps users report in mental-health apps.
>>
##response
> Here’s what reviews and studies most often flag as gaps in mental-health/CBT apps:

Privacy, data sharing, and transparency

Users worry about opaque data practices; popularity isn’t correlated with strong privacy. FTC action against BetterHelp and journalism/reviews highlight widespread tracking/ads and unclear policies. 
JAMA Network
+2
AP News
+2

Modest—and uneven—clinical effectiveness

Meta-analyses find small but significant symptom improvements on average, with variability across conditions and apps; many trials don’t rigorously report adverse events. Users can’t easily tell what’s truly evidence-based. 
PMC
+1

Engagement and adherence drop-off

High early interest often fades: common reasons include feeling too unwell to use the app, low perceived relevance, and competing demands. Studies repeatedly show variable, often low, sustained use. 
PMC
+1

Usability friction & limited personalization

App-store/user-feedback analyses cite confusing flows, buggy tracking, and generic content that doesn’t adapt to symptoms, goals, or culture—reducing perceived “fit” and continued use. 
Human Factors
+1

Safety gaps & crisis handling

Reviews call out inconsistent moderation, triggering content, and scant or poorly integrated crisis pathways; adverse events are under-reported in trials. 
Nature
+1

Inadequate clinician integration and care continuity

Many tools sit outside care pathways (no data export, no clinician dashboards or feedback loops), which limits uptake by providers and sustained patient use. 
JMIR Mental Health

Limited inclusivity & generalizability

Older adults and users in low- and middle-income settings are underrepresented; cultural/linguistic tailoring is often thin, hurting acceptability and outcomes. 
PMC
+1

Evidence signaling & quality labeling are unclear to consumers

Users can’t easily tell which apps are CBT-based, clinician-designed, or validated; app quality is mostly conveyed via star ratings and marketing, not standardized criteria. 
JAMA Network

Cost and monetization pain points

Subscriptions, upsells to coaching/therapy, and paywalls for core features are common complaints in user reviews; they also intersect with trust concerns when tied to data. 
Human Factors
+1

Trust & governance (cross-cutting)

Broader consumer surveys show declining trust in tech companies, especially among women—amplifying reluctance to share health data with apps. 
Deloitte Insights

What these gaps suggest (actionable takeaways)

Lead with privacy: plain-language policies, no third-party ad trackers, and user control over export/delete. (Back it with independent audits.) 
JAMA Network

Show the evidence: list CBT techniques used, publish trial summaries and adverse-event reporting, and display clinician involvement. 
PMC
+1

Design for staying power: symptom-adaptive plans, lightweight daily actions, and relapse/crisis flows baked into the UX. 
JMIR

Integrate with care: interoperable data (PDF/HL7 FHIR exports), clinician portals, and shared decision tools improve real-world use. 
JMIR Mental Health

Build for inclusion: co-design with older adults and diverse communities; localize content beyond translation. 
PMC
+1

If you want, I can map these gaps to specific apps you’re considering and show which ones do best on privacy, evidence signaling, and engagement design.
